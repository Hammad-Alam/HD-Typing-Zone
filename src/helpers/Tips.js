    title: "Use the Correct Starting Position",
    tip: "When practicing your typing skills, it’s important to use proper hand placement. To start, keep your fingers positioned over the home row keys (left hand over the A, S, D, and F keys, and the right hand over the J, K, L, and ; keys), with your thumbs hovering over the space bar. From here, you can move your fingers slightly to reach neighboring keys. Your hands should always return this starting position. These conventions are meant to help you familiarize yourself with the keyboard. As you become more experienced, you can experiment with different variations of this starting position to find the placement that is most comfortable and natural for you.",

  {
    title: "Don't Look Down at Your Hands",
    tip: "Instead of looking down at your hands, focus on your screen. This can be difficult at first, especially if you have not yet mastered the exact placement of the keys. However, looking at the screen will help improve your accuracy because you will be able to catch your typos as they occur. You’ll also begin to memorize the placement of the keys, so you’ll be able to type more quickly as you practice.",

  {
    title: "Maintain Good Posture",
    tip: "Sitting in an upright position is going to make it easier to type faster. If you are used to slouching in your chair or working from the couch, try moving to a straight-backed chair or working at your desk.",

  },
  {
    title: "Find a Comfortable Hand Position",
    tip: "The wrong hand placement can make it uncomfortable to type for extended periods of time. The space bar of your keyboard should be centered with your body, so that you are not reading your screen or typing from an angle. As you type, rest your elbows on the table and keep your wrists slightly elevated. You should never bend or angle your wrists dramatically.",

  {
    title: "Stretch and Take Breaks",
    tip: "Take regular breaks to stretch your hands, wrists, and arms to avoid fatigue and injury.",

  {
    title: "Set Goals and Track Progress",
    tip: "Set realistic goals and track your progress to stay motivated and focused.",

  {
    title: "Be Patient",
    tip: "Typing takes time and practice to develop muscle memory and improve speed and accuracy.",

  },
  {
    title: "Practice!",
    tip: "Nothing is mastered overnight, and in order to really improve your typing accuracy and speed, you need to practice every day. Improving your typing skills will not only make your student life much easier, it will benefit you in your future career as well. It might take a lot of practice to see improvement, but don’t give up. You’ll be typing like a pro in no time!",
